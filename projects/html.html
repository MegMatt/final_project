<h2> Early Life and Education</h2>
<p id = "Early_Life_and_Education">
    
    Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, the son of Thomas Ray Gosling, 
    a travelling salesman for a paper mill, and Donna, a secretary. Both of his parents are of part French Canadian descent, 
    along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish. He and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
    Saints, and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.[9] Because of his father's work, they "moved 
    around a lot" and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington, Ontario.[11] His parents divorced when he was 13, and 
    he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother, an experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to think like a girl". <br>
    <br>
    Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School.
     As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor. He "hated" being a child, he was bullied in 
    elementary school, and had no friends until he was "14 or 15". In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the 
    action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a 
    suspension. He was unable to read, and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not 
    diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication. His mother left her job and home-schooled him for a 
    year. He has said homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost". Gosling performed in front of 
    audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he 
    performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act, and was involved with a local ballet company.[26] Performing 
    boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he received praise. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, 
    as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando.[27] 
    Gosling dropped out of high school at age 17 to focus on his acting career. <br>

                        <br>
                    In 1993, 12-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of the 
                    Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer 
                    and moved to Orlando, Florida. He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were 
                    considered more talented. Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of 
                    his life. Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. 
                    Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in him "this great sense of focus." He became 
                    particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year 
                    of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for 
                    work reasons. Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still 
                    supportive of each other. <br>
                    <br>

                    Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada, where he continued to 
                    appear in family entertainment television series, including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995)[32] 
                    and Goosebumps (1996), and starred in Breaker High (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon. At age eighteen, 
                    he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–1999) as the title 
                    character. He later said that he initially enjoyed working on the series, but began to care too much 
                    about the show, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a 
                    character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to transition into film and not accept any more 
                    television work.<br>

                    <br>
                    Aged 19, Gosling decided to move into "serious acting" and he said quote "It's time to get my Gosling on". He was dropped by his fake as hell agent and initially found it 
                    difficult to secure work because of the "stigma" attached to children's television. After a supporting 
                    role in the football drama Remember the Titans, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's 
                    The Believer. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand 
                    the isolation of Judaism. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an "electrifying and terrifyingly 
                    convincing" performance while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his "dynamite performance" could "scarcely 
                    have been better". The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Gosling has 
                    described it as "the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now." Because of the 
                    controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release,
                     and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime. The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 
                    worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million.<br>
                    <br>

                    In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. 
                    He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was "emotionally disconnected for the whole 
                    film." Critic Roger Ebert felt that the "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the 
                    character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life." A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he 
                    "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché" while David Rooney of Variety felt that his "one-note, 
                    blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer". The film grossed 
                    $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.

                    <br>
                    Gosling gained mainstream attention in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the 
                    romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed 
                    by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling played Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: "It gave me an opportunity 
                    to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative."
                     He sought to imbue his character with "quiet strength" and was inspired by Sam Shepard's performance in 
                     Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook.[55] Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, 
                     in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they 
                     had a combative relationship on the set. "We inspired the worst in each other," Gosling has said. 
                     "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." 
                     At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" because he felt 
                     McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the "spontaneous and combustible" performances 
                     of the two leads and noted that, "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds 
                     against them." Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's "beguiling unaffectedness" 
                     and noted that "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together". The film grossed
                      over $115 million worldwide.[61] Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award. 
                      Entertainment Weekly has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles 
                      Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared 
                      on many Most Romantic Movies lists. <br>

                    <br>
                    Following a three-year absence from the screen, we missed him severely, Gosling starred in five films in 2010 and 2011. "I've never had more energy,"
                     Gosling said as he is an energetic young boy. "I'm more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of 
                     dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I've found a way to have fun while doing it. And I think that translates 
                     into the films." He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working. In 2010, he starred opposite Michelle 
                     Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, the marital drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly 
                     improvised and Gosling has said "you had to remind yourself you were making a film". Mick LaSalle of the San 
                     Francisco Chronicle felt he "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance" while A.O. 
                     Scott of The New York Times found him to be "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit 
                     less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that he "plays Dean as a snarky 
                     working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." However, Wesley Morris of 
                     The Boston Globe felt the performance was an example of "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden 
                     Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million 
                     worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.</li>

                    <br>
                    In 2013's crime thriller Gangster Squad, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD 
                    officer who attempts to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with 
                    Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid, Love. Stone has said 
                    she hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of The New York Times 
                    described the film as an excuse for the cast "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing 
                    whatever sense of nuance they might possess." Christy Lemire of The Boston Globe criticized Gosling's 
                    "weird, whispery voice" and his "barely developed, one-note" character.[132] However, Betsy Sharkey of the 
                    Los Angeles Times felt that there was "a seductive power" in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: "But 
                    like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out."</li>

                    In 2015, Gosling played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire The Big Short, a Best Picture nominee 
                    at the 2016 Academy Awards. David Sims of The Atlantic felt that he was "smarmily funny, somehow simultaneously 
                    magnetic and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema, it's wonderful to see him cut 
                    loose again." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: "Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly 
                    to the camera, and he's volcanically fierce and funny." The following year, Gosling starred in the black 
                    comedy The Nice Guys, opposite Russell Crowe, and in Damien Chazelle's musical La La Land, for which he 
                    won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy 
                    Award for Best Actor nomination. Robbie Collin praised his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone, writing: 
                    "Both stars are so attuned to each other's pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out, perfectly 
                    formed." It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films, with earnings of over $440 million 
                    against its $30 million budget.</li>

<h2> Music Career</h2>
<p id = "Music_Career"> 
    In 2007, Gosling made a solo recording called "Put Me in the Car" available for download on the Internet. Also that year, 
    Gosling and his friend Zach Shields formed the indie rock band Dead Man's Bones. The two first met in 2005 when Gosling was 
    dating Rachel McAdams and Shields was dating her sister, Kayleen. They initially conceived of the project as a monster-themed 
    musical but settled on forming a band when they realized putting on a stage production would be too expensive. They recorded 
    their eponymous debut album with the Silverlake Conservatory's Children's Choir and learned to play all the instruments themselves.
     Gosling contributed vocals, piano, guitar, bass guitar and cello to the record. The album was released through ANTI- Records 
     on October 6, 2009. Pitchfork Media was won over by the "unique, catchy and lovably weird record" while Prefix felt the 
     album was "rarely kitschy and never inappropriate". However, Spin felt the album "doesn't reverse the rule that actors make 
     dubious pop musicians" and Entertainment Weekly criticized its "cloying, gothic preciousness".

<h2> Personal Life</h2>

        Gosling previously resided in New York City.
        He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.
         He bought the restaurant on an impulse; he said he spent "all [his] money" on it, spent a year doing the 
         renovation work himself, and now oversees the restaurant's menus.<br>
         <br>

         Gosling created hit indie game <a href = "https://jebdvis.github.io/wa/wa3">"Five Nights at Freddy's"</a> 
         and published it in 2014. He then created many more sequels in the years to come, and Scott Cawthon is actually Ryan Gosling.
