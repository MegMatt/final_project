            A Website all about me!
            </h2>
                <p>
                    This Website was created for my Final project of my Web class. In this I have three examples of work I've done with html, css, and js. All examples have a procedurally generating website with a json file making it easily scaleable. They can all be sorted into different categories and it is easy to add more or remove them within the json file. In each project site there is an image carousel that loads in images stated in the json file alone with the alts.
