Two toio robots are combined with an assembly that contains a magnet with a lift screw, allowing the system to move magnet-containing objects placed on the tabletop. The resulting platform can be used for tangible play, communication, and co-creation.", "In contrast to previous approaches that use computer vision and fixed cameras for object recognition combined with a modified table, the toios in DOT recognize objects using markers placed on the base of the object, then move them. Because DOT uses a palm-sized assembly for both object recognition and movement, it does not require a stationary setup for object recognition."],

				"description": ["The Vibrotactile Tongue Vision (VTTV) system is an open-source programmable tongue display unit (TDU) that augments visual and auditory experiences through haptic feedback. VTTV is designed to enable those without embedded systems skills to fabricate a TDU, controller, and craft tactile experiences easily. The project also includes a controller to program haptic patterns directly to the VTTV system.", "TDUs typically use electrotactile stimulation to display information to the user. These systems produce sensations by generating voltage pulses from electrodes to the userâ€™s tongue. Commercial TDU systems are closed source, prohibitively expensive, and compromise haptic resolution for user comfort. We propose an alternative to electrotactile TDUs, a novel system that uses ERM motors for actuation. Our goal is to enable anyone to fabricate their own TDU using easily accessible materials with affordable off-the-shelf tools."],

We demonstrate this platform by building a melodica, keyboard, cello, trombone, and percussion. The system utilizes the capacitive touch breakout to create a 12 tone scale. From there, we utilize up to six buttons to modify the sound. In the case of the melodica and keyboard, the buttons can be used to change octaves. In the case of the cello, the buttons function as strings. The wind instruments utilize a microphone in the mouthpiece to detect whether and how hard air is being blown into the instrument."],
